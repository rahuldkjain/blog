One important topic that often gets overlooked (and thrown into the “for old people” category) is eye health.</p>\n<p>In order to protect your eyes against age-related eye diseases, you should incorporate foods rich in antioxidants like vitamin C and E, beta-carotene, blah blah…</p>\n<p>I feel the same too</p>\n<h3>Carrots</h3>\n<p>Vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, eggs, and green leafy vegetables have high amounts of vitamin A and beta-carotene. Vitamin A protects the surface of the eye called the cornea and also makes up the protein (rhodopsin) that allows you to see in low-light conditions.</p>\n<h3>Citrus Fruits</h3>\n<p>According to the WebMD, “Vitamin C is a top antioxidant” for eye health. Vitamin C keeps the blood vessels in your eyes healthy and can combat cataracts and AMD. Fruits like oranges, grapefruits, and tangerines have high amounts of vitamin C.</p>\n<h3>Berries</h3>\n<p>Berries are one of the highest sources for antioxidants found in foods. Blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries are all high in vitamin C and can improve your eye health.</p>\n<h3>Almonds &#x26; Nuts</h3>\n<p>Almonds, along with, nuts, green leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes, and avocados, are rich in vitamin E and omega3 fatty acids. This antioxidant can protect the eye from oxidative damage that can lead to cataracts and AMD and help to clear visions too.</p>\n<h3>Papaya</h3>\n<p>Papaya is packed with great antioxidants such as carotenoids and beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A, important for eyesight. The fruit also has both lutein and zeaxanthin which are useful in protecting the eyes from the Uv and hence retain the vision even in the old age.</p>\n<h3>Corn</h3>\n<p>Corn is a versatile food that can be prepared in many ways, and apart from its great taste, it also has a significant impact in improving the eyesight. To achieve the right amount of lutein and zeaxanthin cook the corn for a longer period. You can serve it with chili or soup, among other dishes.</p>\n<h3>Spinach</h3>\n<p>Spinach is a group of green leafy vegetables which are a source of lutein and zeaxanthin. One cup of spinach has about 20.4 mg of the two components which are important in improving the eyesight. There are so many ways that you can prepare spinach such as cooking or even blending to make juice.</p>\n<p>This is the items I found effective as per availability and nutrition values.
