So sit back relax and enjoy the ride.</p>\n<p>In the lap of a beautiful campus filled with trees, lake and leopards, lucky students\nare having their best time. There is this trio of three musketeers of final semester namely Birju, Shambhoo and Golu.</p>\n<p>Birju being the childish and adventure loving one, decided to go for a night out in the Jungle of Payali with Golu and Shambhoo. He rents a bike and tells Shambhoo about the plan.</p>\n<p>They decided to kept this a secret from Golu as he is a mumma’s boy and will definitely refuse to go.</p>\n<p>Shambhoo is the most practical and mature one out of these three. He decided to ride the bike and it goes like this</p>\n<p>Shambhoo is riding the bike,\nGolu is guiding the ride.</p>\n<p>On seeing the route, Golu frowned,\nwhile the google maps lady says <code class=\"language-text\">route nowhere to be found</code>.</p>\n<p>Air is windy and they get stuck,\nBirju got crazy and says is lit as fuck.</p>\n<p>Frightened Golu, gives a thought,\nTo ask strangers for the way lost.</p>\n<p>It is 10:00 in the night,\nToo late for a person to be in sight.</p>\n<p>Birju starts humming <code class=\"language-text\">Chala jaata hoon kisi ki dhoon mein</code>\nto bring Golu light mood mein</p>\n<p>But the night just got lucky on seeing a man,\nAsking the route to Payali is in the plan.</p>\n<p>Ramesh, the man is tall and walking like a dead,\nShambhoo stopped and laughed seeing his bald head.</p>\n<p>Ramesh stumbles upon seeing them, as wearing only chaddi,\nBirju greets and asks him, as if he is his chaddi buddy.</p>\n<p>Take the dead road by cutting highway to the right.\nRamesh suggests by giving his number to help in the plight.</p>\n<p>They continue the ride beleiving his advice,\nBirju can’t wait for Golu to see the surprise.</p>\n<p>Shambhoo starts singing to enjoy the ride,\nSuddenly, Birju’s phone vibrates in the pocket inside.</p>\n<p>He picked up the phone &#x26; thanked Ramesh for the advice,\n“Have you reached the Banayan Tree”, Ramesh whispered like a mice.</p>\n<p>Shambhoo stops the bike on the reaching the dead end,\n“Woo Hoo” Birju sighed on seeing the place for night to be spend.</p>\n<p>-------------------- Rhyme Ends------------------------------\nNight begins moaning with the soothing wind penetrating through darkness making the sound of silence.\n“What the hell is this place? It seems like a haunted jungle” puzzled Golu asks Birju.</p>\n<p>“Aaj to maja aa jayega bhidu” Birju laughs.</p>\n<p>In the midst of darkness, Shambhoo hear something strange. He starts following the sound and get struck by a thick piece of wood. The piece seems like a lantern used by someone before. He lit up the wood with lighter and continues to follow the sound.</p>\n<p>Birju &#x26; Golu followed him. Suddenly a dog starts yawning like a sad bhootni. Everyone gets so induldged in the situation that they can easily hear their heart’s beating.</p>\n<p>Let’s leave Guys! I don’t want to die like this. My life is good without the adventure. I want to marry Laila. I love my family. I wanna go home. Mumma I wanna go home, Golu starts weeping.</p>\n<p>But Birju got no chill. He begins to stroll quickly as if he wants to have a beer with a bhootni. The strange sound gets strong and clear as they followed. </p>\n<p>Shamboo sees a big container covered with darkness and it comes out to be a school bus.</p>\n<p>School bus is empty with all the windows being closed. Shambhoo moves the lantern to get a clear view and finds that one tyre is punctured and the other one is struck in the mud.</p>\n<p>“What’s up buddy! Lets grab a drink”, excited Birju climbed up the bus through the ladder behind and yelled at an old man.</p>\n<p>“Jai Hanuman Gyan Gunsagar Jai Kapish trilok ujagar” Golu starts praying.</p>\n<p>Birju takes the lantern from Shambhoo and goes towards the old man. The man is stirring something in a big fat pot slowly and slowly under a dim yellow bulb. The place is messy with vegetables, knives, utensils, plates and plastic bags all around.</p>\n<p>Birju stares him in the eys and breaks the silence, “Hey Man! I am Birju. I come here with my friends to hangout”.</p>\n<p>The Old Man looks in his eyes with a plain face as if happens to him all the time.</p>\n<p>“You don’t wanna say something”, Birju asked.</p>\n<p>The Old Man again ignores him with <code class=\"language-text\">don&#39;t want to talk</code> face. </p>\n<p>“Oh you are upset because you are alone. Don’t worry I am here and lets grab a beer together”, Birju tries befriending The Old Man, but the man starts growling.</p>\n<p>“Oh Ok Ok don’t want talk, Fine. I thought you need a company”.\nMan starts stirring again.</p>\n<p>Shambhoo steps towards them seeing the conversation.</p>\n<p>“By the way! Why you are cooking the food so lately?”, Birju again asks the old man impatiently.</p>\n<p>The Old Man gets irratated by the sheer questioning and gestured with hands and ears that he don’t understand the language.</p>\n<p>Surprised Birju replied, “Oh don’t understand what I am saying, got it!”\n“But what are you doing”, Birju gestured with his hands.</p>\n<p>“Chota, Bachcha, Subah” the Old Man gestured.</p>\n<p>In the meanwhile, Shambhoo’s eyes fell upon a big lonely house towards the left. He sees a parked car in the garage and a big board stating “Payali Guest House”.\nExcept, trees, haunted bus and an old man, this is the only house that can be seen all around.</p>\n<p>Birju keeps talking to Old Man and befriends him. He gets to know that the guest house is empty and they can spend the night inside.</p>\n<p>Shambhoo goes to Golu and tells him about the guest house. They move into the house, lit the fireplace as there is no connection of electricity. Birju sits on the floor with a beer in one hand and playing Kishore Kumar sings with the other hand to create a mehfil.</p>\n<p>Golu bottoms up the beer to overcome the fear and starts sobbing to marry the love of his life, Laila. Birju enjoys the vibe by singing along the music to make Golu emotional a little more, while shambhoo keeps drinking, laughing &#x26; thinking about the whole situation.\nFrom “Yeh Shaam Mastaani Madhosh kiye Jaaye” to “So Gaya Ye Jahan So Gaya Asmaan”, everyone fells asleep.</p>\n<p>Flares of sunshine fell into Golu’s face. He wakes up and run towards the bathroom to pee.\nHe gets bamboozled by unconsciously kicking a beer bootle lying on the floor. He rubs his eyes as the bottle rolls across the hall. </p>\n<p>He opens his eyes and finds something strange. He can’t remember what exaclty happened after dancing in the night and sees Shambhoo and Birju lying and sleeping next to each other wearing only <code class=\"language-text\">Chaddi</code>. He starts feeling wet in his legs and finds his pee coming out his Chaddi slowly. Suddenly he sees a Chaddi lying on the floor dying out of loneliness. The fact that this is the same chaddi that Ramesh was wearing, scares the shit out him.</p>\n<p>-----Alarm Sound-----------------</p>\n<p>Umm, Oh thank God it was a dream. What time is it! OMG it’s 9:10. I have to attend the meeting the otherwise the boss will definitely fire me this time. Why God Why. I wanna go back to hostel and live with Birju &#x26; Shambhoo. I really miss them. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Night Out","date":"June 09, 2020","description":"A fictional story about the three college friends"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/TheNightOut/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/HealthyEyes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"List of food items for healthy eyes 👀"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/broweser-keyboard-shortcuts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Super useful keyboard shortcuts for browser"}}}}}
